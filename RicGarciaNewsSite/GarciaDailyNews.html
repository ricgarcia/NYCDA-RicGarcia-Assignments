      <p><img class="teslasedan float-left" src="img/imgres.jpg">We have written example text for over 40 industry sectors, this is an ongoing project and we will be adding more copy if there is a demand so don’t hesitate to get in touch if you see a gap in our industry list. Please note though, that this copy is only designed for use at the concept stage and is not for use on live websites. If you are looking for a copywriter, we do that too so get in touch.

Not Lorem Ipsum was dreamt up and created by 2nd Floor. The idea came from the brain of Chris Wharton, one of the Directors of 2nd Floor, who has been in the web design industry for nearly 10 years. He has been writing his own example copy for his designs for years and thought there should be something that provides a quick but more tailored approach than the standard filler text known as Lorem Ipsum. There are lots of funny spins on Lorem Ipsum, but we couldn’t find anything that allowed someone to browse by industry and choose something related to what they were designing.

The copy has been written by Jude Wharton, 2nd Floor’s Copywriter and Business Director. Jude came up with the name Not Lorem Ipsum and we quickly registered the domain when we saw it was available!

If you’re interested in finding out more about us and our work then you can visit the 2nd Floor website. If not, then stay here and we hope you find some useful copy.
